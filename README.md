# Cartoonize Video

This project provides a Python script that converts a video into a cartoon-like version using OpenCV. The script processes each frame of the video, applies a cartoon effect, and saves the output as a new video file.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

    - Python 3.x
    - OpenCV library
    - NumPy library

You can install the required Python packages using pip:


    pip install opencv-python numpy
    Script Description
    cartoonize_image(img)
    This function takes an image as input and applies a cartoon effect to it. The effect is achieved through a combination of grayscale conversion, blurring, edge detection, and bilateral filtering.

    cartoonize_video(input_path, output_path)
    This function processes a video file frame by frame, applies the cartoonize_image function to each frame, and writes the resulting frames to a new video file.

### How to Use
Place Your Input Video: Ensure the input video file is located at the specified path in the script (input_video variable).

Run the Script: Execute the script using Python. The script will read the input video, apply the cartoon effect, and save the output video to the specified path.


        python c:/Users/4a Freeboard/Desktop/Result/Convert_to_Cartoon.py
    Example Paths
    Input Video Path: c:\Users\4a Freeboard\Videos\AnyDesk\demovedio.mp4
    Output Video Path: C:\Users\4a Freeboard\Desktop\Result\output_cartoon_video.avi
### Notes
Ensure that the input video file exists and the specified paths are correct.
You can change the input and output paths as needed by modifying the input_video and output_video variables in the script.
The output video will be saved in the AVI format using the MJPG codec.
